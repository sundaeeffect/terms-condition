Description of Coaching
Coaching is partnership (defined as an alliance, not a legal business partnership) between the Coach and the 
Client in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires the client to maximize personal and professional
potential. It is designed to facilitate the creation/development of personal or professional goals and to develop 
and carry out a strategy/plan for achieving those goals. 

1) Coach - Client Relationship

A. Client is solely responsible for creating and implementing his/her own physical, mental and emotional 
well-being, decisions, choices, actions and results arising out of or resulting from the coaching relationship 
and his/her coaching calls and interactions with the Coach. As such, the Client agrees that the Coach is not 
and will not be liable or responsible for any actions or inaction, or for any direct or indirect result of any 
services provided by the Coach. Client understands coaching is not therapy and does not substitute for therapy 
if needed, and does not prevent, cure, or treat any mental disorder or medical disease.

B. Client further acknowledges that he/she may terminate or discontinue the coaching relationship at any time.

life. The Client agrees that deciding how to incorporate coaching principles into different areas and implementing 
choices is exclusively the Client’s responsibility. 

D. Client acknowledges that coaching does not involve the diagnosis or treatment of mental disorders as 
defined by the American Psychiatric Association and that coaching is not to be used as a substitute for 
counseling, psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, mental health care, substance abuse treatment, or other professional 
advice by legal, medical or other qualified professionals and that it is the Client’s exclusive responsibility 
to seek such independent professional guidance as needed.

communicate honestly, be open to feedback and assistance and to create the time and energy to participate 
fully in the program.
